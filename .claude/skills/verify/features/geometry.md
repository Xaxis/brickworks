# Geometry

Whether a brick here is the size of a brick in your hand, and whether two of them
can occupy the same millimetre.

<!-- covers: lib:occupancy lattice, lib:sideways building, lib:angled sections, lib:stability -->

## Sub-features

- `occupancy lattice`: every part is a set of 2 LDU cells. A stud is 20 LDU
  across (10 cells), a plate 8 LDU tall (4 cells), a brick three plates. A
  placement names its lowest-leftmost-backmost cell.
- `sideways building`: a part can be held by a stud that does not point up —
  `face` (up/down/±x/±z) × `rot` (quarter turns) gives 24 orientations, and the
  occupied cells are recomputed for each.
- `angled sections`: a sub-assembly built square and then carried at an angle.
  `sections: [{name,x,y,z,axis,degrees}]` plus a `section` field on a brick.
  Collision inside a section is checked in the section's own square frame;
  everything else is checked against the turned cells with a 15-axis separating
  axis test.
- `stability`: whether what was built would survive being picked up — what rests
  on what, what is floating, and what is attached by one stud at the end of a
  cantilever.

## How to reach it

GDScript: `src/assembly/lattice.gd` (cells, `cells_for_turned`, `is_square_to_grid`),
`src/assembly/stability.gd`, and `Section` in `src/ai/assistant.gd`.
Python: `tools/ldraw/occupancy.py` (the same lattice, used by the mesh build).

## How to check it

Static: the Python half is pinned by `tests/test_ldraw.py` — stud pitch 8 mm,
brick 9.6 mm, plate a third of a brick, −Y up, and the lattice dividing every LEGO
dimension. **The six tests that voxelise a part need numpy and scipy** and skip
without them, which is 25 of the 67 cases.

Runtime:

```sh
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/dimensions_probe.gd   # in millimetres
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/snap_probe.gd         # cells
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/snot_probe.gd         # held sideways
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/angled_probe.gd       # not square to the grid
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/section_probe.gd      # built square, carried at an angle
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/stability_probe.gd    # arrangements with known answers
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/holds_probe.gd        # and whether the assistant is told
godot --headless --path . --script src/dev/attach_probe.gd       # are the coordinates usable
python3 tools/minitest.py tests/test_ldraw.py                    # or pytest, if installed
```

Proves it when: every probe exits 0 with no `FAIL`, and `dimensions` ends on
"every measured part is the nominal size, exactly" — a 2×4 brick measured at
32.00 × 9.60 × 16.00 mm, three plates to a brick, 8.00 mm stud pitch. It prints
one `--` line on purpose: LDraw draws a 1.6 mm stud where LEGO moulds 1.8 mm.

## Gotchas

- **A section is checked against itself in its own frame.** Checked against the
  world, a tipped section collides with itself at every angle — three overlaps,
  every time, for a model that is perfectly fine.
- **An angle has to survive a save.** Direction cosines were being trimmed to
  three decimals, which quietly straightened every section. `.ldr` now carries 8
  decimals for the nine matrix elements and 4 for the position.
- **One fault must not read as three.** An overlap also makes things float and
  come adrift; `crowded` suppresses the consequences so the report names the cause.
- **The hint that says where a section would fit was what stopped a design run.**
  Thirty-two trial placements per failing section, each voxelising the section
  against the lattice: measured at 46 s for one failing section, 82 for two and
  **182 for four** — and the relay a session talks through gives up at 180. A
  starship has four candidates, two pylons and two nacelles, so a design fighting
  its pylons made a `check_design` that never came back, and a real Voyager run
  reported "the brickworks server has stopped responding" on every call after one
  edit while the app was alive and finishing normally. Two bounds now: `HINTS_WITHIN`
  caps what one check spends on hints at four seconds and says which it was when it
  runs out (silence there reads as "there is nowhere", the answer that ends runs),
  and `_section_sits` skips the twenty-six-neighbour scan for cells strictly inside
  a brick's own extent, which cannot touch anything outside it. Four failing
  sections now cost 11 s, and `section_probe` fails if a check of them takes 30.
- **The fit window can be a quarter of a plate wide.** `_where_it_would_meet`
  sweeps ±2 plates in eighths and says "At y=3.25 it would rest against the model
  instead of running into it", because nothing else makes it findable.
- Changing the cell size changes the Python lattice *and* the GDScript one. They
  are separate implementations of the same number; `occ.CELL` and `Lattice.CELL`
  both have to move, and `tests/test_ldraw.py` is what notices.
